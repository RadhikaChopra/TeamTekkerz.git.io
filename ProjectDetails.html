  <h1>Detailed Description</h1>
  <h2>Aims</h2>
  <p>
    The overall aim for the project is to create a piece of hardware which will ultimately be implemented into a variety of water storage devices. This tool would assess the levels of water in any storage unit through a connection between the piece of hardware and a software application.<br>
    The primary two components of the project break down to the construction of the hardware and the programming of the software component, these are the bare bones of it which are essential to getting the project running. Our goals can be broken down into the following:<br><br>

Construct a reliable piece of hardware that is able to assess water levels in a variety of storage units of limited capacity. This is a core component of the project as there is no other realistic method of assessing water levels through purely a software basis.<br>
 The hardware must be water-proof, able to sense water levels, consistently transmit water data back and forth between itself and the application. It must also be able to gauge the capacity of the storage unit it is situated within, within a reasonable limit. <br>
 Measuring water levels can be accomplished through a variety of sensors and parameters which the user inputs prior to submerging the hardware into a water-filled container.<br>

Program software that reliably retrieves data from the hardware that is receiving the data. This is also a core essential component of the project, as this would receive all the information necessary for water level assessment and display it visually for our user base.<br>
The application would show a variety of information about the quality and levels of water that the hardware is situated in. Ultimately, the hardware and software component would have the number 1 priority in the development process. The bare minimum would be to accomplish a minimalistic approach to measuring water levels without implementation of any advanced features. <br>

In a case where it is a choice between developing the hardware or programming the software, the hardware would be a higher priority. The reasoning behind this is that visual feedback can be implemented into the hardware component with simple digits or letters rather than a complex application that displays a variety of information.<br>
The hardware could potentially be momentarily submerged into water momentarily and is removed, the hardware would subsequently provide some form of visual feedback about water levels & quality.

  </p>

  <h2>Plans and progress></h2>
    <p>Our plan is to create a functioning water storage management system, mainly focused on applications in the agricultural and humanitarian industries. We believe this will be of great benefit to a large group of people, and will help to make everyday life easier for all involved.<br>
       The project began in its foetal stages as a simple water management unit that would help people living in remote areas, particularly farmers, monitor their water storage levels in things such as tanks, troughs or perhaps even larger bodies of water.<br>
      As a group we believed that we needed to offer more functionality than this as there are a number of competitors. To differentiate ourselves we decided to go down a humanitarian pathway by creating a cheap and easy solution for water management worldwide. <br>
      The unit itself will be a very simple design and will include a microcontroller, RF transmitter and receiver, as well as a float valve to measure water height.<br>
     Once installed in the storage device of the users choice, the float valve will adjust accordingly to the water level and calculations done in the microcontroller will be transmitted to the user via an app on their mobile phone, giving them an on demand insight into the particular water storages’ capacity. A basic illustration of this is included below.<br>
</p>

<p>The four pieces of equipment come together and need to be installed in different spots to make the system work as efficiently as possible. The actual buoy and microcontroller are mounted on the inside of the tank and therefore need to be fully waterproofed to a high enough standard to be fully submersible. From further research this indicated that the device would need to be IPX7 (minimum) standard and it would therefore be able to handle depths of up to 1m for extended periods of time. The scope we have included indicates we are unsure as to whether this product can be manufactured by us or if buying large quantities of small water-tight containers will suffice. This decision would ultimately come down to cost in the infancy of the business, however, if the business were to gain traction we must also consider the environmental impact of the device. We could then perhaps source sustainable materials at an extra cost and use this to our advantage. A 2015 study showed that millennials are looking to be more sustainably smart [1] and as they begin to make up the majority of the workforce in the coming years we believe this choice could be pivotal to the success of the idea at government level. The transmitting RF chip would also be placed with the microcontroller inside the tank. At this point in time we are unsure as to what type or model of RF chip we will use but the choice will be very important in determining the distance at which the signal will be able to be transmitted. Similarly, an RF receiver will need to be placed somewhere within the household if the user wishes to receive updates directly to a desktop.
</p>

<p>A very key and major element to the project idea is the network upon which the devices will function and further the network upon which the user will be able to receive real time data updates. This is a major point of contention for the group as we needed to fit multiple ranging criteria for these elements to be successful. To begin we discussed price and sourcing of the RF pieces. To be able to scale this project to much larger operations, especially in the humanitarian aid field the product would need to be as cheap and easily accessible as possible. This has been quite a difficult topic to get a complete solution for as RF data transmission requires a line of sight to operate, something which many users may not have the luxury of. An average RF transmitter will efficiently transmit data for somewhere within the range of approximately 100m [2]. An RF signal booster can increase the distance of transmission but depends entirely on the height and frequency used, as a thought experiment we suggested that an RF booster would add an extra 75m distance to the transmission. An example of the solution can be seen below.
</p>

<img src"transmitter.png" height=200px width= 300px><br><br>

<p>The distance from the transmitter (tank) to the receiver (household) in a straight line is only 1.5km but is impeded by two hill ranges. Over this short distance of only 1.3km (Distance with transmitter and receiver range removed) the system would need 17 repeaters (green) to transmit the signal successfully. Unfortunately, line of sight creates problems very quickly and would only be magnified in mountainous terrain overseas, but it remains the simplest solution without erecting antennas that are 15+ meters in height. We did however find a solution for this problem, but it has two downsides, cost and complexity. Rather than selling the user a transmitter and receiver we could instead offer them the option to run their signal via satellite. Satellite technology is readily available to the general public and could be used efficiently in this scenario. It would however include a much larger cost to the user as connection fees to the satellite can be upwards of hundreds of dollars yearly. From a humanitarian aspect this cost could be much higher than a decade’s income for people living in extremely remote and poor areas. Further, it increases the complexity of the solution majorly as now we need to know how to effectively maintain and communicate to and from a satellite, skills which at the present time our group does not possess. At this point in time we have thoroughly explored both options, but line of sight remains our preference to begin as we believe it will be the most cost effective to get up and running. If the idea were to take off however we have not ruled out bringing in external help to further modernise our product.
</p>

<p>Another piece of this project we have dedicated a large amount of time to thinking about is the servers and how user data is stored and processed. After discussing options such as creating our own physical servers, cloud computing or remote data management on the users end we decided that storing data in the cloud would be the easiest and most cost effective. Both physical servers and remote data management brought in a wide range of costs to both erect and maintain upkeep as well as adding to complexity. As we are using a microcontroller, we can adapt code inside the device to periodically update the data to a cloud database from which the user will be able to access via desktop GUI or mobile application. Although cloud computing comes at a cost, we decided that the maintenance, knowledge and time required to keep physical servers was much worse than just the cost involved in cloud servers. Depending on which cloud service we chose to store our data with costs would vary anywhere from 21 cents/GB/month down to 9 cents/GB/month [3]. As discovered in A2 we found that cloud computing in modern times is extremely fast and reliable which is of the utmost importance in a project like ours as we need constant updates to the consumer in real time, all the time. Similarly, the protection that cloud computing provides for user data is also very large with most data encrypted so it is kept safe for the intended user only.
</p>

<p>The last and probably one of the most major components we have decided on is the actual hardware and software itself. Hardware involved two components as we needed to decide whether a float valve or pressure gauge would be used to measure water level as well as choosing a suitable micro-controller to satisfy our software needs. As a group we decided that the plan would involve a float valve rather than a pressure gauge for a few reasons. A pressure gauge although a great way to measure water level is required to be at the bottom of the water storage unit. For systems already installed this could require thousands, if not tens of thousands of litres water to be drained to install the unit. This is something we believed would not suit farmers as often they are low on water and any loss can be devastating on livestock and their wellbeing. Furthermore, the effect this could have on remote third world communities could be catastrophic. The water stored is their livelihood and without it they would not be able to work, farm and live. Secondly, the extra costs associated with a pressure gauge were far greater than a basic buoy like device and would make it less affordable, something which we are striving against where possible. Although basic we know it works and a float valve is extremely easy to install and maintain when made of the right materials. The buoy itself would most likely be produced of a hollow plastic where the arm and anchor point would be made of brass as it is both waterproof and durable for a long period of time. The micro-controller itself was thoroughly researched so as we could come to the most informed decision possible, the end result being an Arduino. During the discussion we tossed and turned between the cheaper, less powerful Arduino or more powerful but more expensive raspberry pi. The raspberry pi offered premium services with a larger internal memory and faster processor speeds meaning that the tasks we would be required to do would be completed fast and well within the limits of the microcontroller. It would however cost significantly more than the most basic Arduino model. Further, with our current skill set we did not have any members in our team with python experience, the language which is native to raspberry pi. To begin a project, we thought it would be extremely difficult to learn a new high-level language and apply it at a commercial level. The Arduino although much less powerful than the pi would still offer enough functionality to be extremely well suited to our project idea. It would also allow us to code the device in a language that some of our group was familiar with, C/C++. This was major for us as it gave us an easy to use language upon which we already had built knowledge. As such the plan and scope sets out that we will use an Arduino programmed mainly with C. The software needs further development with the need for some kind of mobile application the user can access their data from. Stand-alone applications were considered for this position but as our knowledge of app building is quite small, we decided to work with an online cloud-based service, appery.io. This would allow us to create a very basic application to use for apple, android and google phone users all in one hit. It did not require a huge amount of programming knowledge and hence was suited extremely well to our needs. The app when opened would be very minimalistic as it is not required to overload the user with information. A basic display showing the current water level of the storage unit and the ability to switch between different storage units would be done with few presses. An alert system is most likely to be developed as shown in the MATLAB scripting which sends a notification to the user when the tank gets below a level specified by them. This is extremely important as it allows for both foreplanning and disaster management as leaks and problems can be detected early.
</p>

<p>All the background research and planning has given us a great base to launch from and begin to progress our project. As it is a major element and would require planning, we believed a network diagram would be extremely useful and with some knowledge of CISCO in our group a network diagram has been created. Although only small scale the model gives a basic look into how one or two units would have to communicate with a server and could then be scaled accordingly to work for multiple users. We have also mocked up a wireframe and working fragger (CHECK PROGRAM NAME) to demonstrate the user interface that would come on the mobile applications. A prototype has been drawn up and is a basic idea of what we think the original design will look like. Of course, as with any design this will most likely change due to new insights we receive along the way and hence why this is only a very early prototype. In the given time frame we would have loved to print a real 3D model but in the current situation this was not possible, in a non-COVID environment this would be done as soon as possible. Finally, a basic MATLAB script of how the device coding will work is included, it gives a great insight into the steps that the microcontroller will take to calculate values and will then send data.
</p>

<p>As of the current schedule we are beginning to mock-up designs and bring this project to life. We have been talking about and working with multiple ideas and we are at the point where these have been narrowed down to a select few that will then be tested to see which functions the best and suits the majority of the factors we are looking for.
