<h1>Reflections</h1>

  <h2>Zen</h2>

  <p>Our group definitely adapted much better this time round, we learnt a lot from previous mistakes and were way more communicative on teams. I’d (finally) fixed my Microsoft Teams notification issue which made things much, much easier. It was nice for me personally to see the final project come together in its current iteration, it really put into perspective the usefulness and the need for the project where water health monitoring is critical.
    Our group was good at delegating tasks yet again; however we did still have people missing from meetings which was quite a downfall as it did make delegating a bit more difficult, however we managed in the end. Overall, if I could rate our collaboration together out of 10 I would give it a 7.5, last time it was an 8. The reasoning behind my rating is that we did have more people missing from meetings including our main meeting with our lecturer.
    We got the project done in the end and adapted quite well to what challenges we had to face. We delegated tasks clearly and met deadlines well too, the previous assignment had well-prepared me in regards to how to approach an online collaboration assignment and how to streamline the process. The key aspect to execute such an assignment I believe is keeping one another updated and communicating whenever possible. It is important to vocalise issues and where you are stuck in an assignment too in order for group members to help out one another as much as possible.

  <h2>Luke</h2>
  <p>In assignment 3 our group adapted quite well and made contributions early compared to A2. We were much more prompt in including work which made it much easier to compile when the assignment had finished. It’s quite difficult to work things like this out as it requires timing and acknowledgement that different people will be busy with other things at certain times even if you’re ready to pump out the last of the project. It was great to see everyone banding together and getting things done when they were required to. Something that could definitely be improved is the consistency and effort that individual members put in. There was and still is an incredible gap in how much some contributed to this project compared to others which was a little disheartening. Something that surprised me was the fact everyone chipped in and was genuinely interested in my A1 project idea was great as I believe it is a solution that could be brought to the real world one day. Groups will never be perfect but as long as everyone chips in and does their part you can end up with a great project, something which I think we achieved.

  <h2>Xavier</h2>
  <p>For assignment 3, I believe our group improved on certain aspects, but also diminished across a few areas as the assignment progressed. Communication appeared to be efficient and effective towards the first half of the assignment, but unfortunately towards the latter half of the assignment, communication seemed to diminish. This was evident in some members not turning up to meetings, as well as some work being difficult to track down and complete. However, compared to assignment 2, I believe that as a group we were able to come together and successfully produced a coherent and well thought out project. In terms of the group as a whole, deadlines set by the group were met more promptly on a regular basis. Each member felt a little more comfortable completing work as I believe the parts signed to each member were tailored to that individual’s skill set. However, there still was an evident gap in the amount of work contributed by each person. In conclusion, I am proud of the way our group worked and the project we developed.

<h2>Radhika</h2>
<p>For this assignment, I personally struggled to find time to make it to meetings and to communicate regularly as my personal life and work was quite busy, however I managed to keep in touch with the group when possible, and was aware of what everyone was meant to be doing. I tried to also be clear about my time constraints to the group so that I could take tasks that I was able to accomplish well rather than in a subpar fashion. As a group I think we were more punctual and willing to put in more effort to get the work done. Most people stepped it up from the last assignment, and as such I think our content is of a higher standard. I do think there was still a lack of communication, and some did do more work than others, but I think we did the best with what we had. It's apparent that a lot of us have differing and busy schedules, so we adapted well and our end product is still great. I think the group dynamics reflected a real world situation, and prepared us well for work life.

<h2>Soe</h2>
<p>In this assignment 3, I unfortunately missed the most important meeting planned for the team with the tutor as I misread the schedule and was away for voting as requested from my parents from back home. I was not able to contribute much to this project. It was really easy to communicate with my team members, they always get to the point and get things done efficiently and successfully with each of them in their own roles. Mainly for this assignment, we did not have many meetings and as mentioned about me missing. I was left off-paced and was not able to get through with my members on what I should do as for my part. Majority of my contribution must have been carried out by some other members and I feel bad about it. It was hard for messages to get through in this lock down situation but it is not to be blamed. In conclusion, I hope I can be a better teammate in the future and that I am sorry for missing out on stuff this time around.

<h2>Group Thoughts</h2>
<p>
As a group we believed our both our work quality and the deadlines were met with a lot more consistency than A2. When group mates were asked to complete their individual tasks they did so to a very high standard and were uploaded before the deadline. Further we all also agreed that communication for this assignment was good for the most part. The majority of group members attended meetings and reported our findings in the practical sessions as required. Having efficient communication allowed us to delegate and discuss tasks to put together the most coherent document we could. Things we could improve on in future assignments is the workload set for each team member. Everyone is studying different things and workloads at certain times may need to be a little different and flexible, we understood this from the beginning but some members failed to step up when required. Sharing the workload was difficult when people missed meetings as it became increasingly hard to delegate what was required. Although disappointing we were able to complete a good report in the end with wireframes and multiple tangible artifacts. One thing that surprised us was the genuine interest even began to have in the one common project. As the project developed and we could see things progressing the group became more invested in trying to create the most accurate and well designed product. We have learnt that even in the best of time mustering a group together can be extremely difficult and online learning has only made that more difficult. Further we have learnt that efficient communication is the key to success. When we were communicating well as a group the work required was being done to a high standard and very quickly, without this the work began to drop off and others had to pick up slack. The Github for our log only involves Radhika and this is a true reflection of our group's work. As Radhika is proficient in HTML we believed it would be best to leave all the programming work to one person so that it was as coherent and logical as possible. This was agreed upon at the beginning of the assignment and Radhika was required to do less of the content work to balance her load.
