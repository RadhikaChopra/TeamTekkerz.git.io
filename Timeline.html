  <h1>Timelines</h1>
<h2>Previous Progress</h2>
  <h2>Week 1</h2>
  <p>As a group, we had already established using Microsoft Teams as our main platform to communicate ideas, schedule meetings, and reach out to other members for help. Therefore, we decided for assignment 3 that we would continue using this platform and agreed to schedule regular meetings (at least twice a week) so that we could allocate work and share any queries.
    During this week we instructed everyone in the group to read over the assignment 3 document on canvas to familiarise ourselves with what is required, and to have in mind what parts each individual would like to complete, so that next week we could come together and allocate parts according to people’s preferences.</p>

    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <p>When coming together on Microsoft Teams, we discussed each other’s strengths and weaknesses, and allocated tasks accordingly. For example, as we are using Luke’s project idea, he volunteered to work on the plans and progress section, whilst members who are strong in coding and website development, for example Radhika, opted to develop the website.
    </p>
      <h2>Week 3-4</h2>
      <p>During these two weeks we met as a group several times. These meetings mostly revolved around discussing any problems we faced with our allocated parts with the aim of receiving helpful feedback. Problems were usually quickly resolved. After further discussion, some members swapped allocated parts with others as we all believed this would suit each other’s strengths more effectively as well as result in certain tasks being completed in a more efficient manner.
      </p>
          <h2>Week 5</h2>
          <p>During week 5 of the assignment, we came together and agreed that each members parts must be near completion so that week 6 can be used to combine everyone parts and so that Radhika (who specialises in website development) can have a sufficient amount of time to design and ensure the website is of a high and coherent standard.
          </p>
            <h2>Week 6</h2>
            <p>After meeting with Anthony on Monday to discuss the assignment, we discussed the finalisation of the assignment and worked to compile all of our sections within the next few days so that Radhika could finalise the website design. By the end of the week, we were satisfied with the standard of the project we have created and made any finishing touches to the design and layout before submitting the assignment to CANVAS.
            </p>
            <h2>Future Planning</h2>

              <h2>Week 7</h2>
              <p>Moving on to the planning phase for the project, we aim to begin exploring avenues to source the required parts to build the device. As we are aiming to source the most cost-effective materials (where possible), we all aim to spend a considerable amount of this week researching potential suppliers.
              </p>

                <h2>Week 8</h2>
                <p>Before entering the manufacturing stage, we decided it was beneficial to do the required tests on the prototype device to acquire an IPX7 standard (at minimum). At this stage we believe that acquiring an IPX7 standard would be satisfactory, however as this does not test the devices ability to prevent the entry of dust, we may decide in the future to acquire an IPX8 standard once we have enough funds available to acquire the highest quality materials to create an upgraded version of the prototype.
                </p>

                  <h2>Week 9</h2>
                  <p>We aim to have sourced a majority of the required materials for manufacturing by this stage. When discussing the potential costs of manufacturing the device on a large scale, we had to decide between a couple of different options. Those options are either; manufacture overseas at a substantially lower cost, but a greater risk of faulty or poorly built devices. Or keeping the manufacturing process within Australia, ensuring quality craftsmanship, but a much higher cost. After discussing, we decided to begin with using overseas manufacturing in China, as we believe we would need a large inflow of cash with minimal expenses.
                  </p>
                    <h2>Week 10</h2>
                    <p>To get the product off the ground, we decided that a strong marketing campaign directed towards Australian farmers would get the ball rolling in terms of awareness and sales. We are looking to run advertisements on multiple different media (internet, tv, radio, newspaper), primarily targeting areas in the country and farmlands.
After we have proved successful and built a solid customer base within Australia, we aim to look internationally, especially with aims to assist in humanitarian needs in developing countries.

                    </p>
                      <h2>Week 11</h2>
                      <p>We have decided to include pre-orders for our device, as they are still in the manufacturing stage. The option to pre-order will be made available on our website. To entice farmers to try our device over other competitors' products, we will offer a full-refund or replacement if they are not happy with their devices, as well as our product being the cheapest available on the market. We aim to use the funds from pre-orders to further extend our marketing campaign.
                      </p>
                        <h2>Week 12</h2>
                        <p>
                          By week 12 of development, we aim for the manufacturing process to be at a stage where we can begin distribution for pre-orders. Orders will be sent via mail, as the device is not large and is very easy to set up. We are predicting that if the product meets the required standard of farmers, they will spread our product through word of mouth.
                        </p>
                          <h2>Week 13</h2>
                          <p>
                            By this stage, we hope to compile a large amount of feedback regarding the initial operations of the device. Hopefully, this advice will mostly be positive in nature. From this feedback, we will review our current position and may decide to start developing an upgraded device, with more features and better quality materials. However, this may only be achieved if the first device is deemed a success.
                          </p>
                            <h2>Week 14-15</h2>
                            <p>For these two weeks of the project, we have decided it would be beneficial to meet as a group at minimum 4 times a week. These meetings would be hands-on, meaning that strong and meaningful analysis of our current position, as well as coming to base with what resources we have to keep moving forward. If everything goes according to plan, then by this stage we will have established a strong customer base and acquired meaningful and positive feedback about our product. If this is the case, then we will begin to market overseas, offering a cheap and reliable product to assist in humanitarian aid across the globe.
                            </p>
                              <h2>Week 16</h2>
                              <p>By the final week, we hope to not only continue to build on our customer base within Australia, but to also have established large customers overseas who are interested in our products. We also are thriving towards gaining the support of large charities who primarily work in developing countries to build infrastructure in poor communities. By acquiring these large charities as customers, we predict that our product will begin to grow at an immense global scale. Looking further into the future, we hope to see our product used in thousands of water storage facilities across the globe. Whether that be in our own backyard in farmland Australia, or across the globe helping developing communities thrive.
                              </p>
